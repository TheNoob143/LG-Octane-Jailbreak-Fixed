Step 1: Choose the computer
Use your Windows PC for this step.

Reason: LG/Qualcomm USB drivers, BitPim, and QPST/LGNPST run natively on Windows.

Linux (Arch) will be used later for analysis of dumps or firmware, not direct phone connection.

Step 2: Install drivers on Windows

Download and install Qualcomm/LG USB drivers for Windows.

Restart the computer if needed.

Connect the phone via USB cable.

Open Device Manager and verify the phone is recognized:
Look under Portable Devices or COM Ports.

✅ Goal: Windows can communicate with the phone for media and data access.

Step 3: Choose the mode on the phone

Some LG feature phones prompt for USB mode:
Mass Storage / File Transfer → safest mode for copying files.

Avoid “PC Sync” or “Flashing” modes unless you are experienced.

No SD card is required for connecting and exploring internal storage.

Step 4: Open BitPim

Launch BitPim on Windows.

Select your device model (LG Octane VN530).

Wait for BitPim to detect the phone.

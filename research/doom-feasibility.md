# Doom Feasibility on LG Octane (VN530)

## 1️⃣ Purpose
- Document whether it’s theoretically possible to run Doom on the LG Octane.  
- Highlight limitations and requirements.  
- Provide a reference for safe experimentation or simulation.

---

## 2️⃣ Phone Specs Relevant to Doom
- **CPU:** Qualcomm MSM6500 (~200–300 MHz)  
- **RAM:** 128 MB  
- **Screen:** 240×320 pixels, 16-bit color  
- **Storage:** ~48 MB internal, microSD (16–32 GB)  
- **OS:** BREW 3.x platform  
- **Input:** Numeric keypad, directional pad  

---

## 3️⃣ Challenges
- **Platform limitation:** BREW apps must be compiled and signed; unsigned apps generally won’t run.  
- **Performance:** CPU and RAM may not handle smooth gameplay.  
- **Controls:** Keypad is limited; mapping Doom controls would be awkward.  
- **Screen resolution:** Small and low-res; aspect ratio may require scaling.  
- **Storage:** Limited internal storage; large game assets may not fit.  

---

## 4️⃣ Requirements for a Port
- Access to **BREW SDK** for compilation.  
- Modification of Doom source code:
  - Map controls to keypad buttons  
  - Adjust graphics routines for 240×320 resolution  
  - Reduce memory usage / optimize assets  
- Carrier signing (or emulator) to run on real device.  

---

## 5️⃣ Safe Experimentation Ideas
- Use **emulators** to simulate Octane hardware and controls.  
- Test **dummy BREW apps** (graphics, input, audio) to understand compilation process.  
- Document memory, CPU, and storage usage for future feasib

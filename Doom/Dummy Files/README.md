# Dummy Files — LG Octane Doom Research

This folder contains **safe placeholder files** used for experimentation and analysis related to Doom research on the LG Octane (VN530).  

> ⚠️ These files are **not real Doom game files** and do **not** run on the phone.  
> They are for testing tools, emulators, or file analysis only.

---

## Purpose
- Test **emulator behavior** with dummy binaries.  
- Explore **memory, file system, and storage handling** safely.  
- Practice using analysis tools (e.g., `binwalk`, hex editors) without risking the phone.  

---

## Example Files
- `dummy_file.bin` — small placeholder binary for testing  
- `test_image.jpg` — example image file for emulator or SD card simulation  
- `test_music.mp3` — safe audio file for testing playback or storage limits  

---

## Usage Notes
- Keep all dummy files **separate from real backups** or phone data.  
- Label files clearly to avoid confusion.  
- Safe experiments can be logged in the `notes/` folder using `note-template.md`.
